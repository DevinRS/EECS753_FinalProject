# MCUNet Reproduction: Tiny Deep Learning on IoT Devices

This project aims to reproduce the results of the **MCUNet** paper:  
> *"MCUNet: Tiny Deep Learning on IoT Devices" (NeurIPS 2020)* by Ji Lin et al.

Our focus is on deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained microcontrollers, specifically targeting the **Visual Wake Words (VWW)** task (i.e., person detection).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Reproduce MCUNet's person detection task using **TinyNAS** and **TinyEngine**
- Deploy trained and quantized models on microcontrollers (e.g., STM32F746 or Raspberry Pi Pico)
- Benchmark model accuracy, memory usage, and latency
- Document the full process, highlighting challenges, successful strategies, and implementation notes

---

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

1. **Literature and Code Review**
   - Analyze the MCUNet paper and official GitHub repository
2. **Model Reproduction**
   - Use TinyNAS to design and quantize models for the VWW dataset
3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy models using TinyEngine on a microcontroller
4. **Benchmarking**
   - Evaluate accuracy, SRAM/Flash usage, and inference speed
5. **(Optional)** Re-implement TinyNAS or TinyEngine from scratch

---

## ðŸ“¦ Expected Outcomes

- Working implementation on STM32 or equivalent MCU
- Metrics comparable to the original paper
- A short demo of real-time image detection
- Written report of replication effort
