# MCUNet Reproduction: Tiny Deep Learning on IoT Devices

This project began as a reproduction of the **MCUNet** paper:
> *"MCUNet: Tiny Deep Learning on IoT Devices" (NeurIPS 2020)* by Ji Lin et al.

Our original focus was on deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained microcontrollers, specifically targeting the **Visual Wake Words (VWW)** task (i.e., person detection). Midway through, we pivoted based on practical challenges and resource constraints. The revised project focuses on re-implementing the **TinyNAS** component and demonstrating its adaptability to alternate datasets and toolchains.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Reproduce MCUNet's person detection task using **TinyNAS** and **TinyEngine**
- **(Achieved)** Replicate model zoo results for VWW and run models on benchmark dataset
- **(Pivot)** Address deployment issues when integrating camera input on STM32
- Refocus on implementing and experimenting with the **TinyNAS** component
- Demonstrate the flexibility of TinyNAS by adapting it to:
   - A **ResNet-style backbone**
   - A **TensorFlow Lite** optimization pipeline
   - A lightweight **Rock-Paper-Scissors** dataset
- Document the process, highlight lessons learned, and evaluate modularity of MCUNet components

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

1. **Literature and Code Review**
   - Analyze the MCUNet paper and official GitHub repository
2. **Initial Reproduction**
   - Successfully reproduced VWW model results using pre-trained models
3. **Deployment Challenge**
   - Encountered persistent issues running camera-integrated inference on STM32
4. **Pivot and Refocus**
   - Shifted effort to study and adapt TinyNAS to a custom training and deployment pipeline
   - Used TensorFlow Lite for deployment to avoid needing to learn TinyEngine internals
   - Switched to Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset for simplified data collection and training
5. **Experimentation**
   - Modified search space and architecture within TinyNAS to evaluate backbone flexibility
